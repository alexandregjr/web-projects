# Basic Calculator
This app allows you to convert a value in money to cents, also giving the 
minimum amount of coins needed to achieve that value (in coins of 50¢, 25¢, 10¢,
5¢ and 1¢). 
The app accepts a float value, ignores everything after the second decimal value
and use this value to calculate amount of cents and coins.

## Usage
Just open the `index.html` file with your preferred browser!

## Dependencies
