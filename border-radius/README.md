# Border Radius Previewer
The page has four inputs to select the values of each corner's border-radius. 
The user can input a number or a number followed by the percentage character. 
The system will show the preview on the div coloured and if the user clicks on 
the textarea bellow the selector, it will copy the css to the clipboard.

## Usage
Just open the `index.html` file with your preferred browser!

## Dependencies
The project has no lib dependencies, it uses vanilla JS, HTML and CSS. 

## Future Changes
- [ ] Change size of display div to fit user needs
- [ ] Create combobox for user to select unit ('%', 'px', 'em', ...)
